TriggerList.tex - A Getting Things Done stress reducing exercise
========================================================================


## The Point

TriggerList is derived from [The 43 Folders Trigger
List](http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/Trigger_List).  If you're
not familiar with a Trigger List, the idea is simple: this is all the
spheres of your life, in general, that you care about.  If you're
stressed out and not sure what to do next, print this out, and line by
line either scratch off or annotate what you need to do next.

## Compiling

This is mostly written for xelatex.  So:

$ xelatex TriggerList.tex
